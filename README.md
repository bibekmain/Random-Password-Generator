# Random Password Generator

## Description
This project is my submission for Module 3's homework on Javascript. This project is a random password generator that lets the user choose what kind of characters and how many characters to include in the password.

The HTML and CSS files for this submission was taken from the homework template. The Javascript file was initially a template but I added on to it what was required for the homework submission. Part of the code layout for the Java Script file is pulled from the demo shown by Sam during class time, though it was only used as a template.

## Directions:
- Click on Generate Password Button.

- Enter a number between 8 and 128 for the length of password to be generated.

- Select OK or CANCEL to choose which characters to include in the password to be generated.

- If the password length is between 8 and 128, and at least one of the character criteria is selected, a password will generate in the space accordingly.
